**A smart, context-aware patch tool for the modern developer.**

`mpatch` applies unified diffs to your codebase, but with a twist. Instead of relying on strict line numbers, it finds the correct location to apply changes based on the *surrounding context*. It's designed to work seamlessly with patches generated by AI, copied from pull requests, or stored in markdown files.

---

## Why `mpatch`?

The primary motivation for `mpatch` comes from working with Large Language Models (LLMs).

When you ask an AI like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot to refactor code, it often provides the changes in a convenient markdown format with ` ```diff` blocks. **However, you can't trust that the line numbers are correct.** Sometimes, even the surrounding context lines aren't a perfect, character-for-character match to your current code. A standard `patch` command will often fail in these situations.

**This is the core problem `mpatch` was built to solve.**

It intelligently ignores line numbers and uses a fuzzy, context-based search to find where the patch *should* apply. This makes it highly resilient to the small inaccuracies common in AI-generated diffs, allowing you to apply them with confidence.

This same logic makes it perfect for other common developer scenarios where patches are less formal:
*   **Code Snippets:** Using a diff copied from a GitHub comment, a blog post, or a team chat.
*   **Iterative Development:** Applying a patch to a branch that has slightly diverged from where the patch was created.

---

## Core Features

*   **Markdown-Aware:** Directly parses unified diffs from within ````diff` code blocks in any text or markdown file.
*   **Context-Driven:** Ignores `@@ ... @@` line numbers, finding patch locations by matching context lines. This makes it resilient to minor preceding changes in a file.
*   **Fuzzy Matching:** If an exact context match isn't found, `mpatch` can use a similarity algorithm to find the *best* fuzzy match, allowing patches to apply even if the source has slightly diverged.
*   **Safe & Secure:** Includes a `--dry-run` mode to preview changes and built-in protection against path traversal attacks.
*   **Flexible:** Handles multiple files and multiple hunks in a single pass. It correctly processes file creations, modifications, and deletions (by removing all content from a file).
*   **Informative Logging:** Adjustable verbosity levels (`-v`, `-vv`) to see exactly what `mpatch` is doing.

## Installation

### Method 1: From GitHub Releases (Easiest)

For users who don't need to build from source, pre-compiled binaries are the simplest option.

1.  Navigate to the [**GitHub Releases page**](https://github.com/romelium/mpatch/releases).
2.  Download the appropriate archive for your system (e.g., `mpatch-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`).
3.  Extract the `mpatch` executable.
4.  Move the executable to a directory in your system's `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on Linux/macOS, or `~/.cargo/bin`).

### Method 2: From Crates.io (Requires Rust)

If you have the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) installed, you can install `mpatch` directly from the official package registry:

```bash
cargo install mpatch
```

### Method 3: From Source (for Developers)

To build the very latest development version or to contribute to the project:

```bash
# Install directly from the main branch of the repository
cargo install --git https://github.com/romelium/mpatch.git

# Or, to work on the code locally:
git clone https://github.com/romelium/mpatch.git
cd mpatch
cargo install --path .
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
mpatch [OPTIONS] <INPUT_FILE> <TARGET_DIR>
```

### Verifying Changes with `--dry-run`

Before modifying any files, you can preview the exact changes using the `-n` or `--dry-run` flag. This is the safest way to start.

```bash
mpatch --dry-run changes.md my-project/
```

This will produce a diff of the proposed changes for each file, printed directly to your terminal:

```
----- Proposed Changes for src/main.rs -----
--- a
+++ b
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 fn main() {
-    // This is the original program
-    println!("Hello, world!");
+    // This is the updated program
+    println!("Hello, mpatch!");
 }

------------------------------------
DRY RUN completed. No files were modified.
```

### Applying Changes

Once you are confident in the proposed changes, run the command without `--dry-run`. Use `-v` for informational output.

```bash
mpatch -v changes.md my-project/
```

You will see a confirmation log:
```
Found 1 patch operation(s) to perform.
Fuzzy matching enabled with threshold: 0.70

>>> Operation 1/1
Applying patch to: src/main.rs
  Applying Hunk 1/1...
  Successfully wrote changes to 'my-project/src/main.rs'

--- Summary ---
Successful operations: 1
Failed operations:     0
```

### Key Options

*   `-n`, `--dry-run`: Show what changes would be made without modifying any files.
*   `-f`, `--fuzz-factor <FACTOR>`: Set the similarity threshold for fuzzy matching, from `0.0` (disabled) to `1.0` (exact match). Default is `0.7`.
*   `-v`, `--verbose`: Increase logging output. Use `-v` for general info, `-vv` for debug details, and `-vvv` for trace-level inspection.
